    <s1 title="Introduction">
      <p>
        This page provides information about how to access Batik's
        source code.  There are four main ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first, and prefered method for developers, is
          through AnonCVS. Anyone can checkout source code from
          our anonymous CVS server. To do so, simply use the
          following commands (if you are using a GUI CVS client,
          configure it appropriately):<br/>
          
          <code>cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic login</code><br/> 
          <code>password: anoncvs</code><br/> 
          <br/> 
          <code>cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic checkout xml-batik</code><br/><br/>
        </li>

        <li>The second and probably easiest is by downloading a <link
            href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xml/batik">source
            distribution</link>.  These are the packages that start
          with 'batik-src'.  These correspond to the major releases of
          Batik.<br/>
        </li>

        <li>The third is by downloading a <link
            href="http://cvs.apache.org/builds/xml-batik">nightly
            build</link>.  The '-cvs-' packages contain a complete
          copy of CVS.  The '-src-' packages contain only what is
          needed to build and run Batik.  The biggest difference
          being that CVS includes the <link href="test.html">test
            infrastructure</link>.<br/>
        </li>

        <li>The fourth is through <link
            href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/xml-batik"
            >viewcvs</link>.  This provides the ability to traverse
          the CVS repository over the web, and check differences
          between versions.  This is generally only useful for tracking
          a small number of files/changes.
        </li>
      </ul>
