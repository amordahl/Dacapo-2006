     It started with Smalltalk<br>
    OTI has been building tools for platform-independent OO development since
  1988. Our ENVY&reg; technology first brought collaborative software development,
  version management and shared repositories to Smalltalk. IBM is one of
many   companies to license ENVY, which continues to be the foundation of
VisualAge&reg;   Smalltalk.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
      Next came Java&#8482;<br>
    Because of our expertise in OO technology, IBM turned to OTI for a next-generation
  development environment for Java. The result is VisualAge for Java, which
  continues to win awards for its innovative IDE and team support. InfoWorld
  has chosen VisualAge for Java as development tool of the year - year after
  year after year!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
      Then pervasive computing<br>
    OTI continues its development of IBM's VisualAge Micro Edition, a state-of-the-art
  platform for collaborative development of embedded applications and systems
  that are very lean. As the steady stream of press releases attests, VisualAge
  Micro Edition is already licensed to the leading microchip manufacturers,
  microkernel developers, and producers of handheld and consumer devices.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
      Now it's Eclipse<br>
    OTI has built the next generation IBM application development tools platform.
  Eclipse is a kind of universal tool platform - an open extensible IDE for
  anything and nothing in particular. The real value comes from tool plug-ins
  that "teach" Eclipse how to work with things - java files, web content,
graphics,  video - almost anything you can imagine. Eclipse allows you to
independently  develop tools that integrate with other people's tools so
seamlessly you won't know where one tool ends and another starts. The IBM
supported version of this technology, WebSphere Studio Workbench, will be
the core of the next  generation of IBM and IBM Business Partner e-business
tools optimized for  the WebSphere software platform.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
      So what's next?<br>
    OTI continues to deliver object-oriented technology that scales across
 platforms,  across teams and across project size. From a mainframe to a
watch  - we're  closing in on that vision.<br>
